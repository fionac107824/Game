<h2 id="board">Board Game Exploration</h2>
<p>Our game revolves around four animals who wish to exchange homes with the animals across from them. 
However, one problem persists. The road that they will have to take to go 
to their new home is filled with dangerous obstacles that will lengthen their journey.
From this board game creating process, I learned how much thought and planning would have to be given into game design.
For example, we really wated our game to be innovative and difficult, but also not too challenging to the point where
playes would stop trying at all. This really allowed me to think about every step of the way when creating our game and appreciate the thought
of actua game designers who design unique and interactive board game.Creating the rules and all of the designs were also very challenging
as we had to give everything a purpose. Overall, I enjoyed creating this board game because it took a more hands on approach 
to creating a physical game.</p>
	
<h3> Rules of Our Board Game</h3>
<p> 4 players are recommended.
Your goal is to get across the board. Red to yellow and blue to green.
Start with picking the pieces and place the pieces in their designated space on the board. 
Each player rolls the die. Whoever rolls the largest number is the first to go. Then the game operates clockwise.
Then you just keep rolling the dice. If you step on the obstacles you will go back based on the color they have.
If you happen to land on any of the blocks that are colored in green you will be transported to the truck without a red top. Then you will have to roll the die twice. If you land even numbers 2x in a row, you will be transported to the black piece that makes you start all over.
If a player is already on a block and you land on it you go back three steps.
You have to end on the exact same number.</p>
	 

<h2 id ="video">Video Game Exploration</h2>
<p>For this video game creation, I found it very entertaining. It was interesting to see how our prior knowledge on creating our own github websites through
through the use of code to create our own little game. I really liked how the activities that we did before such as creating our own pixel art 
would be useful in creating our own game. I liked how the tutorial was straight forward so I was able to spend some time on creating my 
game characters from a fox to a bunny and adding different sound effects. I really like this game deisgn because it was easy and it allowed me to 
be creative and create my own game designs.</p>
